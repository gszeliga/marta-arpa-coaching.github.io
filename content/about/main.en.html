    <p class="about-me">
      With more than 15 years of experience in consulting, coaching, and project
      management, I have supported organizations and individuals through
      profound change processes. My purpose is to foster human and
      organizational development, creating environments where innovation,
      collaboration, and learning become drivers of sustainable growth.
    </p>

    <p class="about-me">
      My approach integrates strategic clarity with active listening and
      empathy, enabling transformations that allow individuals and teams to
      overcome challenges, reinvent themselves, and achieve their most ambitious
      goals. Throughout my career, I have learned to read between the lines, to
      perceive what is not said, and to build genuine connections that generate
      trust and commitment.
    </p>

    <p class="about-me">
      I do not believe in instant solutions or ready-made formulas: I trust in
      the power of self-knowledge, strategy, and strong relationships as the
      foundations for driving meaningful and lasting change. This combination of
      vision, experience, and sensitivity defines the way I support people and
      organizations on their journey of growth and transformation
