Have you ever felt you don't deserve your achievements and that, at any moment, someone will discover you're "not that capable"? That feeling has a name: impostor syndrome. It's not a disorder, but a thinking pattern that leads competent people to doubt themselves and attribute their success to luck or external factors.

It often appears when we step outside our comfort zone: a new job, a professional challenge, an important project, or even personal changes. Instead of recognizing growth, the mind interprets novelty as proof of inadequacy.

### Common signs

- Minimizing achievements.
- Constant comparison with others.
- Feeling you must know everything before acting.
- Excessive fear of making mistakes.

### What helps manage it

- Reviewing real evidence of your abilities.
- Talking openly about your doubts.
- Accepting that learning involves not knowing.
- Treating yourself with the same understanding you offer others.

### Coaching as an ally

Coaching can be a powerful tool for addressing impostor syndrome because it provides a safe, structured space to observe your thoughts without judgment and question the beliefs behind them. Through powerful questions and guided reflection, it helps distinguish facts from interpretations, recognize inner resources, and build a more realistic and empowering self-narrative.

The process doesn't stop at awareness—it moves into action. Designing small steps, validating progress, and sustaining commitment allows confidence to become an experience, not just an idea.

Impostor syndrome doesn't mean you're not capable; often it means you're growing. And growth almost always feels uncomfortable before it feels natural.
