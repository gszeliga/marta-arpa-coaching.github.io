title: What is Ontological Coaching?
---

<p>
Ontological coaching is a revolutionary discipline that goes beyond
  traditional coaching. It
  <span class="marker-highlight">focuses on the being</span> of the person, not
  just on what they do or have. This methodology delves into how we interpret
  and construct our reality through three fundamental domains: language,
  emotions, and embodiment. <br />Unlike other forms of coaching that focus on
  specific goals, ontological coaching seeks a holistic transformation that
  allows people to expand their way of being in the world. It is a journey of
  self-discovery that reveals new possibilities for action and thought.
