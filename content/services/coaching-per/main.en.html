title: What is Ontological Coaching?
---

<div>
  <p>
    Ontological coaching is a revolutionary discipline that goes beyond
    traditional coaching. It
    <span class="marker-highlight">focuses on the being</span> of the person, not
    just on what they do or have. This methodology delves into how we interpret
    and construct our reality through three fundamental domains: language,
    emotions, and embodiment. <br />Unlike other forms of coaching that focus on
    specific goals, ontological coaching seeks a holistic transformation that
    allows people to expand their way of being in the world. It is a journey of
    self-discovery that reveals new possibilities for action and thought.
